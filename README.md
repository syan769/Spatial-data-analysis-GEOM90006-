## Analysing the Impact of Rainfall Variability on Traffic Crashes Across Local Government Areas in Victoria 
Understanding the relationship between weather conditions, particularly rainfall, and traffic crashes is critical for improving road safety. Previous studies have highlighted the significant impact of rainfall on accident rates. For instance, Jaroszweski and McNamara (2014) found that rainfall significantly increased the rate of road accidents in urban areas of Manchester and Greater London. Similarly, Eck et al. (2022) demonstrated that the risk of traffic crashes in the Carolinas increased substantially with higher rainfall intensity, particularly during morning rush hours and winter. Khan et al. (2008) used spatial statistical techniques to identify weather-related crash patterns in Wisconsin, emphasizing the importance of spatial analysis in understanding these relationships.

Building on these insights, our study aims to explore the correlation between rainfall and car crashes across different LGAs in Victoria, Australia. We hypothesize that the LGA with the highest crash rate also experiences the highest rainfall. Our research question is: '**How does rainfall variability affect the frequency and severity of traffic crashes in different LGAs in Victoria?** ' By analyzing car crash data and rainfall data, we aim to identify potential risk areas and provide evidence-based recommendations for traffic safety measures. The expected outcome of our research is a set of detailed maps showing the spatial distribution of car crashes and rainfall, along with statistical analyses to determine the strength of the correlation between these variables. Our hypothesis is that LGAs with higher rainfall will also exhibit higher crash rates, highlighting the importance of implementing targeted safety measures in these areas. 

### Data Sources:
There are three types of data has been used in this study. 

* Car Crash Data (Point Data): Sourced from the Victorian Road Crash Data provided by the Department of Transport.
* Rainfall Data (Raster Data): Historical rainfall gauge data from the Bureau of Meteorology.
* LGA Data (Polygon Data): Obtained from Data.gov.au to determine the spatial relations of car accidents within LGAs.

### Scope: 

* Geographic Area: The entire state of Victoria, Australia.
* Spatial Scale: Regional level analysis to compare different LGAs within Victoria.
* Time Scope: The study will focus on car crash data from the year 2022 and long-term rainfall data to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between rainfall and car crashes over a relevant period.
